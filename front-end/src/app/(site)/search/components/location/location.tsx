              Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the
              Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old cityâ€™s mazelike
              alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra
              Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the
              city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015
              earthquake. Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and
              Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt.
